This is a simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built using Django, a popular Python web framework, and SQLite as the database. The goal of this project is to create a secure authentication system where users are assigned specific roles, such as admin, moderator, or regular user, and can only access certain parts of the website depending on their role.

Key Features:
User Registration: Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password. Once registered, they are automatically logged in and redirected to their dashboard.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their username and password. The system authenticates their credentials, and based on their role, they are redirected to their respective dashboards.

Role-based Dashboards: Different types of users (e.g., Admin, Moderator, and Regular User) have access to different dashboards. Admin users can manage other users, moderators can handle specific content, and regular users can view their profile.

Secure Authentication: The system uses Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system, which handles user login, logout, and password management securely.

Error Handling and Messaging: Users are notified with helpful error messages if there is an issue with registration or login (like incorrect credentials).

How It Works:
Registration: When a new user registers, they provide their username, email, and password. After successfully submitting the form, the system creates a new account and logs the user in immediately, showing a welcome message.

Login: Users who already have an account can log in with their credentials. If they enter the correct username and password, they are granted access to their dashboard. If the credentials are wrong, the system displays an error message.

Role-based Access: Each user is assigned a specific role. Depending on their role, they are redirected to different pages:

Admin: Admins can manage the system, view all users, and perform administrative tasks.
Moderator: Moderators can manage content, review user-generated data, etc.
User: Regular users can only view their profile and have restricted access to other parts of the site.
Tech Stack:
Django: Used as the backend framework to handle user authentication, routing, and database interactions.
SQLite: A lightweight database used to store user data and credentials.
HTML/CSS: Used to design simple and clean user interfaces for the registration and login pages.
Why Use RBAC?
RBAC is an essential security model in web applications. It ensures that each user can only access the parts of the site that are relevant to their role. This is important for protecting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access, and creating a smooth user experience where users only see what they need to.

Conclusion:
This RBAC project is a great starting point for anyone looking to implement role-based authentication in their web applications. It shows how to handle user registration, login, and role-based access control securely and efficiently using Django.
